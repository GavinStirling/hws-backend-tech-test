# HWS Backend Technical Test

## Explanation

I added service and repository layers to project as well as adding a delete to ensure full CRUD functionality. This is more similar to a real world eexample which won't make use of an in memory DB.

In terms of testing, I added the NSubstitute and Fluent Assertions modules to mock the calls and assert the responses. I have only tested the API layer (ToDoController) but could also test the application layer (ToDoService) but can be possibly a bit redundant. 

Please let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks,
Gavin
